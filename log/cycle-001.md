## 2026-05-24 cycle-1 — forward cg_solver_integration [L0→L1] — revise

- Synthesis: 1 rotation_claim(s); no diff applied
- Verdict: revise.
- Friction: The slice mixes three distinct concerns at L1: (a) top-level ProblemType dispatch to BaseSolver subclasses, (b) IoData DEFAULT→CG resolution, (c) ConfigureKrylovSolver/BaseKspSolver composition. The fact that the middle link (driver Solve() → BaseKspSolver construction) is unverified and left as an open question suggests this slice is trying to span too much. The 'end-to-end linkage' diagram has a '(per driver) constructs BaseKspSolver' step that is hand-waved..
- Structural change: none.
