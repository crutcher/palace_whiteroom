# Open questions ledger

Cross-cycle ledger of open questions about the target source or methodology. Replaces the old `questions.md` (which stays in place as the archive of seed questions from BOOTSTRAP).

**Format** (one section per question):

```yaml
---
slug: short-kebab-case
opened_at: cycle-NNN | YYYY-MM-DD
opened_by: <agent-name> | human
last_revisited: cycle-NNN | null
status: open | investigating | answered | dropped
answered_at: cycle-NNN  (when status=answered)
answered_in: <commit-sha> | <slice-path> | <ledger-pattern>  (when status=answered)
---
```

Each section: **slug**, **question text** (1–3 sentences), **context** (where this surfaced and why), and **status**.

**Discipline:**
- Any agent appends; never edits existing sections (except status).
- Integrator promotes per-report REPORT.md "Open questions / caveats" sections into this ledger on landing.
- Meta-phase reviews open questions periodically and may drop stale ones (status `dropped` with reason) or promote into friction-ledger / skill-candidates.
- Cycle-planner reads as a priority input — long-open questions get attention.

## Open

```yaml
---
slug: axpy-l1-l0-three-subpatterns
opened_at: pilot-1
opened_by: harvester
status: open
---
```

The L1>L0 lowering theme for `axpy` will need to cover three sub-patterns observed in the L0 corpus: bare `y.Add(α, x)` / `y.AXPY(α, x)` member call; `α == 1` specialisation to `operator+=` (vector.cpp:704-706); `α == -1` specialisation to `Subtract` (vector.hpp:118). All three lower from the same L1 `axpy`; the theme should note per-constant L0 pattern-match rules. Routes to abstractor when dispatched.

```yaml
---
slug: axpby-axpbypcz-next-harvest
opened_at: pilot-1
opened_by: harvester
status: open
---
```

Palace has `AXPBY` (`y = α·x + β·y`) and `AXPBYPCZ` (`z = α·x + β·y + γ·z`) at `palace/linalg/vector.hpp:130-136`. These are L1-distinct operators worth harvesting. Includes a fusion-vs-decomposition trade-off (should `axpby` be primitive, or `axpy ∘ scal`? Palace fuses at L0). Record decision in `scaffolding/decisions/axpby-as-primitive.md` once made.

```yaml
---
slug: scalar-promotion-typing-rule
opened_at: pilot-1
opened_by: harvester
status: open
---
```

The complex-scalar overload `AXPY(double, ComplexVector, ComplexVector)` (`vector.cpp:715-718`) raises whether the L1 signature should formalise real→complex scalar promotion as a typing rule rather than per-operator prose. Long-term L1 type-system concern; revisit after several real/complex operators are harvested.

```yaml
---
slug: l1-index-refresh
opened_at: pilot-1
opened_by: integrator
status: open
---
```

`book/src/L1/index.md` may want an intro refresh now that the dep-map has one entry (axpy). Should mention populated dep-map and link to the operator. Routes to layer-intro-author. Low priority — defer until ≥3 L1 operators land.
